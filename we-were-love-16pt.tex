\textbf{\textsc{\large We Were Love}}
\vspace{26pt}

We were love\\
or love was suddenly remembering us\\
the way two lines cross\\
and the nearest necessity\\
you know nothing about, finds you.\\
The way two people meeting\\
can suddenly slice through the fabric of an evening\\
revealing the fabric of another evening in another world.\\
The way\\
we donâ€™t have to know everything;\\
we just have to want to let everything know us.\\
