\vspace{32pt}

\noindent If the gods bring to you\\
a strange and frightening creature,\\
accept the gift\\
as if it were one you had chosen.\\

\noindent Say the accustomed prayers,\\
oil the hooves well,\\
caress the small ears with praise.\\

\noindent Have the new halter of woven silver\\
embedded with jewels.\\
Spare no expense, pay what is asked,\\
when a gift arrives from the sea.\\

\noindent Treat it as you yourself\\
would be treated,\\
brought speechless and naked\\
into the court of a king.\\

\noindent And when the request finally comes,\\
do not hesitate even an instant---\\

\noindent Stroke the white throat,\\
the heavy, trembling dewlaps\\
you've come to believe were yours,\\
and plunge in the knife.\\

\noindent Not once\\
did you enter the pasture\\
without pause,\\
without yourself trembling.\\
That you came to love it, that was the gift.\\

\noindent Let the envious gods take back what they can.\\
